Requirements
- Motivation and problem statement
	- RL for Robotics
		- Complicated! Dynamics is complicated, state space is massive, etc.
		- Incredibly data heavy
	- A brief description of related work and background
		- Different solutions
			- Collecting the data
			- Doing domain shifts
			- Data augmentation
			- Real-to-sim
- The proposed method for the project
	- We will look at a specific class of problems, that have something called symmetries.
		- Consider the duck example from Desmond and Serena’s presentation yesterday
			- Rotated space and action spaces
	- In our project, we will be looking at special functions that “bake in” symmetries into the Neural Networks.
		- Cite the main papers that show the results
		- Equivariant Neural Networks
			- “Tell it what a rotation looks like in the state space”
			- “Tell it how it should rotate when the state space is rotated”
			- Use cool math to figure out how to tie the parameters together
- A description of your experiments and main results
	- Motivating examples
		- Snake: and graph
	- Bulletarm
		- Symmetry of images around a center location
		- Data Augmentation (augmentation buffer)
	- State space
		- Translation symmetry, as well as rotation and translation symmetry
			- GIF of task
			- Diagram to show the symmetry
			- Graph to show the results, comparing SAC Equiv to Vanilla SAC
- Additional discussion, limitations, and future work
	- Symmetry Breaking
		- Forthcoming in the final report
		- Explain the situation

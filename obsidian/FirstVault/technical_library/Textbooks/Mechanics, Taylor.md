I want to read chapters 7/8 and 13 from this textbook, to have a good understanding of the Hamiltonian.

### Chatper 6
I will start with chapter 6, as a refresher on the E-L equations.
- Problems can often be stated in terms of minimizing some variational principle. That is, the function that is the solution to the problem minimizes some operator that spits out a scalar function.
- We assume the operator $\int f(y', y, x)dx$ is minimized by some $y^*(x)$, and then compute the derivative of this operator with respect to a derivative $\alpha$ for some $\frac{\partial S}{\partial\alpha}$, when we write $y = y^* + \alpha \eta$ for some perturbation function $\eta$. This yields the E-L equations, $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} - \frac{d}{dx} \frac{\partial f}{\partial y'} = 0$. If we have more variables, all with respect to the independent variable $u$, then we have the set of equations $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \frac{d}{du} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i'}$.

### Chapter 7
- It is easy to show that Newton's laws are the same as the E-L equations of a special operator called the Lagrangian: T - U, where T is kinetic energy and U is potential.
- We can then change the co-ordinates on this operator, to work with any operator we like (and re-derive the E-L equations for the new co-ordinate system).
- In general, the interpretation of the E-L equations are "Change in Generalized Force" = "Change in Generalized Momentum". More to come!
- Holonomic system: the degrees of freedom are sufficient to describe the state.
- The principle of least action states that, among all possible paths a system could take between two fixed points in a fixed time, the actual path makes the action $S=\int_{t_1}^{t_2} (T−U) dt$ stationary (usually minimal). This does not mean the particle chooses the shortest distance, but rather the path that balances how long it spends at different potential energies. At higher potential energy, it must slow down (less kinetic energy); at lower potential energy, it speeds up. If it moved slowly in low-potential regions or too quickly in high-potential regions, the action would be larger. For example, in a uniform gravitational field, the least-action path for a particle that starts and ends at the same point is a parabola: it rises (trading kinetic for potential energy), lingers briefly near the top as it slows, then accelerates back down. The shape of the path and the velocity at every instant are the result of this tradeoff between kinetic and potential energy.
- The proof in the case of constrained co-ordinates relies on the fact that constrained co-ordinates do no work: work can be in some ways described as taking potential energy in the context of the Lagrangian, and converting it to kinetic energy. So, the constrain forces do nothing to increase or decrease U or T, so they have no impact on the path, so long as our path is physical (stays on the constrained paths, which require that all constraining forces are normal to the path).

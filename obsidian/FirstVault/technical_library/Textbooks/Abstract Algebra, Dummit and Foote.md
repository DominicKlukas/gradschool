## 15.1 Linear Actions and Modules over Group Rings
A group ring is a formal sum of a the elements of a group with coefficients being the elements of the field.
- Different ways of looking at it!
	- Vector space over $F$ if we associate the elements of $F$ with $Fe$, where $e$ is the identity on $G$.
	- $F$-algebra (a ring that has $F$, in this case $Fe$, in its center)
- Commutative ring iff $G$ is commutative
- Any finite group has zero divisors! Consider any generated cyclic group. Then, $r = 1+ g + \dots + g^{n-1}$ is an element that has $r = rg$, and so $0 = (1 - g)r$, which is a zero divisor!!
We also define representation of a group, and hammer down some notation for $GL(V)$ and $GL_{n}(F)$.

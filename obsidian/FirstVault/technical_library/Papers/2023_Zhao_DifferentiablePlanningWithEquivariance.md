- Integrating Symmetry into Differentiable Planning with Steerable Convolutions
	- This is for planning algorithms: they look at a gridworld problem they have never seen before, and have to come up with a plan for it.
	- They show that theoretically speaking equivariant networks are better and also perform better empirically.

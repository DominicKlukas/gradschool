Behavior Cloning: Learning a policy by supervised learning instead of RL. Compute loss to computed expert behavior.
Classical sim-to-real: train completely in simulation, and then act completely in real life.
Here: act in simulation, mimic in real life, and then correct the simulation state with real life.

- Trained data is collected on the real robot.

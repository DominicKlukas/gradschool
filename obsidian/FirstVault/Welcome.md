This vault will contain my notes and thoughts for my graduate studies.

Make a note of something, [[AI-driven autonomous systems]], or try [the Importer](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer)!

When you're ready, delete this note and make the vault your own.

Can I link to things i have already made, like [[Physics Aware Learning]]?

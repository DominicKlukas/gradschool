# Research Proposal Information
## NSERC
### 4. Outline of proposed research (attachment)

The single attachment consists of two separate sections: _Outline of proposed research_ and _Bibliography and citations_. **Each of these sections must be only one page**. Pages in excess of the number permitted may be removed before the selection process and your application may be at a disadvantage as a result.

**Outline of proposed research (one page maximum)**

Provide a detailed description of your proposed research project for the period during which you will hold the award. Be as specific as possible. Provide **background information** to position your proposed research within the context of current knowledge in the field. State the **objectives and hypothesis** and outline the **experimental or theoretical approach** to be taken (citing literature pertinent to the proposal) and the **methods and procedures** to be used. State the **significance of the proposed research** to a field or fields in the health sciences, natural sciences and/or engineering or social sciences and/or humanities, as appropriate.

If the output of your degree program is an artistic creation rather than a thesis, clearly indicate the research component of your proposed work. Outline the objectives of your research, the context, methodology and contribution to the advancement of knowledge.

If your degree program does not involve a thesis, a major research paper/essay or a major research project, clearly outline the research component of the degree.

If you have not yet decided on a specific project, you must still provide a detailed description of a proposed research project. You may change your research direction or activities during the course of the award. Certain restrictions may apply. Refer to the [Tri-agency research training award holder’s guide](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Students-Etudiants/Guides-Guides/TriRTA-TriBFR_eng.asp).

In addition:

- You are expected to write your outline of proposed research independently. Ideas and text belonging to others must be properly referenced.
- Include all relevant information in the outline. Do not refer reviewers to URLs or other publications for supplemental information.
- In the outline of proposed research, provide the requested information according to the guidelines and format standards outlined in the [presentation standards](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/ResearchPortal-PortailDeRecherche/Instructions-Instructions/CGS_M-BESC_M_eng.asp#presentation_standards).

**Bibliography and citations (one page maximum)**

Provide a bibliography that includes citations for all works referenced in the research proposal. These citations should be in a format used by the primary discipline of the proposed research. You must ensure that all citations are clear and complete to allow reviewers to easily locate the sources.

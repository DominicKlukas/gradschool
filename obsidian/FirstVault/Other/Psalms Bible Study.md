# First Study
## Introduction to the Psalms

A warm welcome, everyone. I’m so glad you’re here. Tonight, we begin our journey through the book of **Psalms**.

The ancient Hebrew title for the book is _Tehillim_ (תְּהִלִּים), which means _praises_. These are Israel’s ancient songs of praise and prayer to God — songs that have shaped the hearts of God’s people for over three thousand years. Just as we sing worship songs together today, these poems were sung by generations of believers — first by Israel, then by the early church — as prayers to God.

But why study the Psalms today? Why should we care about a collection of ancient poetry?

I want to share **three reasons** why I believe studying the Psalms deeply, and praying them regularly, matters and is important for every follower of Jesus.

### **1. The Psalms Teach Us to Pray and Live Honestly Before God**

The Psalms are God’s gift to teach us _how_ to speak to Him.

Even though they are _human prayers addressed to God_, the church has always recognized that they are also _God’s Word to us_. God inspired these words so that we might “enter His presence with the right posture of heart.” In other words, God not only listens to our prayers — He teaches us how to pray them.

The Psalms give us language for the full range of human experience: joy, sorrow, anger, confusion, and hope. They show that _nothing_ in our hearts is too messy to bring before the Lord. When we pray the Psalms, we learn to offer all of ourselves — our emotions, fears, and desires — as a living sacrifice to God (Romans 12:1).

On a personal note, reading the Psalms regularly has changed how I handle stress and sorrow. When I began praying through them, I noticed that the Psalms didn’t suppress emotion — they purified it. My frustrations at work, confusion in relationships, and moments of joy all found their proper place: not bottled up, not vented destructively, but _offered_ to God in trust, and leading me through my sufferings into love, joy, thanksgiving, and praise.

In a world full of unfiltered expression and unprocessed emotion, the Psalms teach us the _healthiest_ way to express our hearts — before the One who can actually heal them.

### **2. The Psalms Form Our Wisdom and Shape Our Worldview**

The Psalms are not just prayers; they are profound reflections on _how to live_.

They invite us to meditate — not just read — on what it means to walk in God’s ways. Psalm 1 sets the tone: _“Blessed is the one who delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it day and night.”_ (We will study this Psalm today!)

Being God's words to us, the Psalms as prayers help us to have God's heart for the world, and see the world as God sees it. They teach us to lament injustice, rejoice in God’s goodness, and find hope when circumstances are dark. Through the Psalms, we learn the rhythm of godly living: waiting, trusting, repenting, rejoicing.

In a time when so much media and ideology shapes our emotions and values in unhelpful ways, the Psalms renew our minds. They’re not escapist poetry — they’re spiritual formation. They shape us into people who live wisely and fruitfully in God’s world.

### **3. The Psalms Point Us to Jesus and Help Us Understand the Gospel**

Ultimately, the Psalms are about **Jesus**.

More than just prayers and poems with wise perspectives, the Psalms as a book, if you read it cover to cover, actually tell the story of _God returning to dwell with His people_. They express Israel’s longing for God’s presence — in the temple, among His people, in His creation. They speak of a coming King who would establish justice, conquer evil, and bring peace. As we, together, proceed to study the psalms, not only will this story give us a new heart for our broken, world; Jesus saw Himself as the fulfillment of this hope. After His resurrection, He said to His disciples in **Luke 24:44**,

> “Everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”

Jesus has given us the amazing offer, that through his power, we can be a part in his restoration project. Jesus Himself is the true King and the true Temple which we, his body, are a part of, where heaven and earth meet. When He died and rose again, God’s presence was no longer confined to a building in Jerusalem but poured out into His people through the Holy Spirit. In view of the Gospel, the psalms powerfully delight in these wonderful things God has done.

It’s no wonder the Psalms are the **second most quoted Old Testament book in the New Testament**. They are the bridge between the Old and New Covenants, and give us tremendous insight into understanding the gospels and how to live out a gospel shaped life.

### **Conclusion**

So why study the Psalms?

1. They teach us to **pray honestly** and bring all of life before God.
2. They shape us with **wisdom** to live faithfully in God’s world.
3. They draw us closer to **Jesus**, revealing the heart and meaning of the Gospel.

In short, the Psalms form our hearts, our minds, and our hope. My prayer is that as we study them together, we’ll learn not only _about_ God — but to _walk_ with Him more deeply, finding our voices in the same ancient prayers that shaped Jesus Himself.

## Study on Psalm 1

In the first part, we’ll focus on **one psalm**, reading it closely together and reflecting on what it teaches us. In the second part, we’ll take a **broader look at the Psalms as a whole**, exploring the key themes and ideas that run throughout the book, which we can then put into practice as we read individual psalms.

Today, I thought it would be appropriate to start at the beginning!

To understand what Psalm 1 means — and what it _does_ — we first need to remember what the Psalms themselves are for. The Psalms lead us into prayer. But if we are to pray rightly, we must first be in God’s presence. And for God to hear and receive our prayers, we must belong to Him — we must be among those in whom He delights, in whom He delights to answer. 

Psalm 1 stands at the entrance of the Psalter like a **gate** through which we walk before entering that holy space of prayer. It shows us what kind of person God calls _blessed_ — the kind of person who can truly dwell in His presence. It does this by setting before us two paths: **the way of the righteous** and **the way of the wicked**.

### Psalm 1

1. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,
   nor stands in the way of sinners,
   nor sits in the seat of scoffers;
2. but his delight is in the law of the Lord,
   and on his law he meditates day and night.
3. He is like a tree planted by streams of water
   that yields its fruit in its season,
   and its leaf does not wither.
   In all that he does, he prospers.
4. The wicked are not so,
   but are like chaff that the wind drives away.
5. Therefore, the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
   nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous;
6. for the Lord knows the way of the righteous,
   but the way of the wicked will perish.

### Notes on Hebrew Poetry
In order to understand what this poem is communicating to us, we have to understand how it communicates. The Psalms communicate meaning not primarily through rhyme, but through **structure** and **parallelism** — the art of developing ideas in patterns that reveal deep meaning.

- **Parallelism:** Sub-verses often expand, contrast, or reinforce one another, in a repetitive AA, ABAB, or ABCABC etc. structure.
	- Example: _“His delight is in the law of the Lord / and on his law he meditates day and night.”_
- **Merism:** Two extremes that imply totality (e.g., _“day and night”_ → all the time), or ("heaven and earth" -> everything in the world).
- **Chiasm:** A mirrored pattern (A-B-C-D-C-B-A) that highlights a central truth.

When studying, ask:
- What verbs are used in each line?
- How do subverses build on each other? How are they similar? How are they different?
- How is the Psalm structured as a whole?  

**_Take 10 minutes to read the psalm 3 times — slowly, reflectively, asking questions like these._**

Now, we can compare notes! Here are a couple of the things that I observed:

#### **Verse 1**
What does _blessed_ mean? How can we know what a word means in the Bible? A sure way is to compare the use of a word in one verse, with the use of a word in many other verses. For example, Job 5:17–21 gives us lots of context to understand the word _blessed_. A concordance like BlueLetterBible on the internet is a very helpful resource at times like these. If we look at the passage in Job, we can see that it doesn't simply mean “happy,” but living under **God’s favor and protection**. We can also look at verse 3 to see what the Blessed person looks like. He receives sustenance and stability from God's living water. The psalmist defines blessing not by their own good fortune and circumstances, but by their dependent **relationship** with God.

Notice the progression:

- **Walk → Stand → Sit**
    
- **Counsel → Way → Seat**
    
- **Wicked → Sinners → Scoffers**
    

This shows how sin deepens by degrees — from listening to wicked counsel, to standing in the way that sinners stand, to finally belonging among scoffers, who actively mock God's word. The individual slows down and gets stuck, and progressively worse.

---

#### **Verse 2**
This verse contrasts the first. The righteous person doesn’t merely obey God’s law — he _delights_ in it, and listens to it. Tim Keller reflects on the idea that, before we enter God's presence to pray, we should listen to his words, so that he would strike the first note in our conversation. Also, we should listen to God: in our lives, this means resisting worldly voices that shape our minds through gossip, cynicism, or pride, and instead dwelling deeply in Scripture so that God’s words shape our desires.

---

### **Verse 3**
More on this later, I will ask you to reflect on this image in the discussion.

---

### **Verse 4**

> “The wicked are not so…”

The contrast is stark. The wicked are **like chaff** — light, hollow, and easily blown away.  
Notice how short this verse is, emphasizing their _insignificance_.  
The psalmist uses brevity itself to underscore the emptiness of evil, in contrast to the steadfastness of the tree.

---

### **Verses 5–6**

Here, _to know_ implies intimate approval — not mere awareness but covenantal favor. We can see this if we look up other uses of the word in scripture. 
The psalm ends as it began: with two **ways**.
Just as in _Deuteronomy 30:19_, God sets before us the way of life and death.  
Psalm 1 invites us to walk the way of life, to become people whose hearts are rooted in His Word.

Discussion Questions
- Do you find it an exaggeration that the Psalmist speaks of "taking delight" in God's law, and meditating on it day and night? How can we become better listeners to God's word, especially in the context of prayer, where we are seeking to have a dialogue with God?
- Are you offended or comforted by God's judgement of the wicked? Take a note of your thoughts... we will continue to explore this theme in the rest of the Psalter.
- Trace the imagery of the tree, and water through the Bible, from Genesis to the Prophets to the Gospels. How does it speak in to the message of this psalm?

## Talk on Worldviews
There is a buzzword going around that I actually think is quite helpful in studies like this: the word is worldview. I find it is a helpful concept whenever you are trying to see the world through someone else's eyes, whether that be someone from a different culture, a different time, or in this case, both.

Your worldview is something that runs very deep within every one of us. Stated simply, it is a set of deeply ingrained questions and answers we have about the world, that shape how we react to and see the things that happen to us and around us. Some key questions that cut to the heart of your worldview are: 
- Why are we here? 
- Who am I? 
- What is my purpose? 
- Is there anything wrong with the world, and if so, what is the solution?

We have before us two competing world views:
- The modern world-view is based on the premise that God, or gods, if they exist, are far away and don’t have anything to do with the world. If they exist, they perhaps once created the universe and the world, but the world is now operating completely on its own steam, with life and death being arbitrary processes within it.
- The Bible, however, presents a different worldview: Covenantal Monotheism. God deeply loves and cares for His world, interacts with it to this day, and forms relationships with the creatures He has created. Each of these worldviews has drastically different implications. But the Psalms are special because they give us songs to sing that enable us to inhabit the Bible’s worldview. They give us a beautiful imagination.  
	- The Bible is God's word, and so it is God's perspective, the worldview God wants us to live by and see through.
	- Until we have a good understanding of this worldview, reading the Bible can be difficult! Luckily though, through studying the Bible we can learn it!

Questions
- What would you say are the mainstream cultural answers to these “key questions”? How do these beliefs shape people's actions and emotions?
- Can you think of a movie, or story, that you think aggressively promotes a particular worldview? What is this view, and how does the story communicate it?
- Describe, in as much detail as you can, your current understanding of the Biblical worldview.
- What is your worldview, based not only on what you would say, but on your actions and the way you respond to circumstances in your environment?

## Introduction
This week, we studied **psalms of lament**, following last week's focus on psalms of trust (Psalms 23 and 139).

**What is lament?**  
Lament is an expression of grief or sorrow, often mixed with protest or complaint. Though it may seem opposed to faith, Scripture shows that bringing our grief to God can be an act of trust.

Key passages on suffering and grief:
- Psalm 119:67, 71, 75, 78  
- Romans 5:3–4  
- Deuteronomy 8:1–3  
- Hebrews 5:8  
- Job 1 (Does Job worship God for God’s sake or for His blessings?)

**Theme:** Suffering teaches dependence on God. Through it, we learn to worship Him for who He is rather than for His gifts. Lament psalms train us to bring our suffering to God in submission and trust, finding joy, hope, and strength in Him. They have tremendous power in transforming our character, and teaching us patience and humility.
## Structure of Lament Psalms
Most lament psalms include five elements:

1. **Direct Address / Introductory Petition**
2. **Lament / Complaint**
   - Usually focused on threats to God’s kingdom and will, including our own sin (e.g., Psalm 51)
3. **Confidence**
   - Reasons for trusting God to act, grounded in His character (justice, steadfast love) or sometimes the psalmist’s innocence
4. **Petition**
   - Formal request, often with reasons why God should respond
5. **Conclusion of Praise**
   - Most laments end in praise (Psalm 88 is the major exception, though it still expresses hope)

**Exercise**: Read Psalm 13, and break it up into sections based on these categories.
Try praying your own prayers in this pattern as well!

## Psalm 51

### Context
Psalm 51 was written after Nathan confronted David about his adultery with Bathsheba. Details emphasizing the seriousness of David’s sin:

- David remained at home instead of going to war with his army
- He attempted to cover the pregnancy by sending Uriah home
- Uriah refused out of loyalty, even when drunk! His righteousness contrasts with David's wickedness.
- David then arranged Uriah’s death and married Bathsheba

When confronted, David responded with humility, submitting himself to God’s judgment or mercy.

### Study Notes
- Lament
	- David acknowledges his sinful nature from birth—not as an excuse, but with deep sorrow
- Petition:
	- legal pardon (“purge me… blot out my sins”)
	- moral renewal (“create in me a clean heart”)
- Confidence
	- He expresses confidence by vowing that if restored, he will:
		- teach sinners
		- sing of God’s righteousness
		- declare God’s praise
- The psalm lacks a full conclusion of praise; David recognizes that before offering sacrifice or praise, he must be made right with God (v. 15–17, 19)

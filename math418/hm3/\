\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.2cm]

\item An ecology graduate student goes to a pond containing $n$ water beetles and captures 60 of them,
marks each with a dot of paint, and then releases them. A few days later she goes back and
captures another sample of 50. Let $X$ denote the number of marked beetles found in her sample
of 50.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Determine the probability mass function of $X$, i.e., find $P(X = k)$ for each $k$.
    \item She finds 12 beetles in her sample. Show that the function $P(X = 12)$ is initially an increasing
    function of $n$ which then becomes decreasing after reaching a maximum value. Find the
    maximum likelihood estimate for $n$; that is the value of $n$ which maximises $P(X = 12)$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution.}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We observe the following.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There are $n$ choose 50 ways to choose the 50 waterbeetles.
            \item If we know that $k$ of the 50 have marks, then those $k$ can be chosen in $60$ choose $k$ ways, and the remaining $50 - k$  can be chosen in $n - 60$ choose $50 - k $ ways.
            \item The previous point helps us realize, that if $n - 60 < 50 - k$, there are not enough water beetles without marks fo r us to choose 50 with $50 - k$ not having marks.
        \end{itemize}
        Putting these together, we have:
        \[
        P(X = k) = \begin{cases}
            \frac{\binom{60}{k} \binom{n - 60}{50 - k}}{\binom{n}{50}} & \text{ if } n \ge  110 - k\\
            0 \text{ else}
        \end{cases}
        .\] 
\end{enumerate}

\item By definition, a random variable is a function $X : \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\{\omega : X(\omega) \leq x\} \in \mathcal{F}$ for
every $x \in \mathbb{R}$. The distribution function $F_X : \mathbb{R} \to [0, 1]$ of the random variable $X$ is defined by
$F_X(x) = P(X \leq x)$. Suppose that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are both random variables.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Prove that $Y = \min\{X_1, X_2\}$ and $Z = \max\{X_1, X_2\}$ are also both random variables.
    \item Let $X_1, X_2$ be independent random variables. Find simple expressions for the distribution
    functions $F_Y$ and $F_Z$ in terms of $F_{X_1}$ and $F_{X_2}$.
\end{enumerate}

\item 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let $Z_n$ be any sequence of random variables. Prove that if $P(|Z_n| \geq \varepsilon \ \text{i.o.}) = 0$ for every
    $\varepsilon > 0$ then $P(\lim_{n\to\infty} Z_n = 0) = 1$.
    \item Let $X_n$ be any sequence of random variables. Use part (a) and the Borel–Cantelli Lemma to
    prove that there are constants $c_n \to \infty$ such that $P(\lim_{n\to\infty} X_n/c_n = 0) = 1$.\\
    \textit{Hint:} Start by fixing a sequence $\varepsilon_n \downarrow 0$ and find $c_n$ such that $P(|X_n| \geq \varepsilon_n c_n)$ is summable.
\end{enumerate}

\item Let $A_1, A_2, \ldots \in \mathcal{F}$ and let $\tau$ be the tail field. If you have good intuition about the events $\{A_n \ \text{i.o.}\}$
and $\{A_n \ \text{a.a.}\}$ and about the meaning of $\tau$ then it should be “obvious” that these two events each
lie in the tail field. Write a proof that $\{A_n \ \text{i.o.}\} \in \tau$ and $\{A_n \ \text{a.a.}\} \in \tau$.

\item For integers $d \geq 2$, the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is the set of all $d$-component vectors of integers. A bond
is a pair $\{x, y\}$ of adjacent elements of $\mathbb{Z}^d$, i.e., with $\|x - y\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^d |x_i - y_i| = 1$. In bond
percolation, bonds are independently occupied with probability $p$ and vacant with probability
$1- p$, where $p \in [0, 1]$ is fixed.

We enumerate the bonds in some manner, from inside out, as $b_1, b_2, \ldots$. The sample space $\Omega$
consists of binary strings representing the occupancy status of the bonds, and the probability space
is the corresponding biased coin flip space (heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $1-p$
for fixed $p \in [0, 1]$), which is the modification of the probability space for independent fair coin
flips (Section 2.6) with $P(A_{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}) = p^h(1 - p)^{n-h}$, where $h =
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$ denotes the number of heads among $a_1a_2 \cdots a_n$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item Let $E$ be the event that there is an infinite connected cluster of occupied bonds. Prove that
    $E$ truly is an event, i.e., is in the $\sigma$-algebra.\\
    (Suggestion: for $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, consider the event $E_{x,k}$ that $x$ is a vertex in a connected
    cluster of size at least $k$ vertices. Construct $E$ from these events.)
    \item Prove that $E$ is in fact a tail event for the sequence of events $O_1, O_2, \ldots$, where $O_n$ is the
    event that the $n$th bond is occupied.
    \item Let $E_0$ be the event that the origin is in an infinite cluster. Prove or disprove: $E_0$ is a tail
    event for the sequence of events $O_1, O_2, \ldots$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Recommended problems.} The following problems from Rosenthal are recommended but are not to
be handed in:

3.6.4 (assume that $f$ is bounded below), 3.6.10, 3.6.12, 3.6.14 (assume the $X_i$ are independent),
3.6.18 (This problem is different in different printings of the text; use $S_x = \{\liminf_{n\to\infty}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{A_i} \le x\}$. If the $A_i$ all have $P(A_i) = p \in (0, 1)$ then what do you think the graph of the function $f(x) = P(S_x)$
looks like? Later we’ll have the theory for this, the Strong Law of Large Numbers.)

\noindent \textbf{Quote of the week:}\\
\emph{I graduated from Douglass College without distinction. I was in the top 98\% of my class and damn glad to be there. I slept in the library and daydreamed my way through history lecture.
I failed math twice, never fully grasping probability theory. I mean, first off, who cares if you pick a
black ball or a white ball out of the bag? And second, if you’re bent over about the color, don’t leave it
to chance. Look in the damn bag and pick the color you want.}\\

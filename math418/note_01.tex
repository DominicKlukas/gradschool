\note{1}{Wed 03 Sep}{What is control?}
\section{1. Introduction to Control}
\subsection{Case Studies}
We started by looking at a few different cases of control, to motivate the course and show that control problems show up all over the place, in places we might not expect\ldots
\begin{itemize}
    \item Car engine coolant valve control.
    \item Interest rate adjustment by banks. Normally: $i = (r^* + \pi) + a (\pi - \pi^*)$.
    \item Autonomous trucks: distance between the trucks.
    \item Computer has to decide how fast it wants to send and recieve packets.
    \item Artificial Pancreas.
    \item Power grid. Incredibly complicated system.
    \item Landing a rocket.
    \item Vacuum tube sound amplifier.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Course Outline}

No assignments. We will be given suggested exercises. A course project: mini-paper: concise, clear, and well-strutured, due at end of term. Python notebook: functional, well documented, reproducible; due at end of term. Prerequisites: control systems fundamentals: transfer functions, state space functions.

Terms to look into.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimal control
    \item Centralized control
    \item Model Predective control
    \item Bang Bang control
    \item PID control
    \item Feed forward control
    \item Distributed control
    \item Multi agent control
\end{itemize}
